# 🏥 Healthcare-Analytics-Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
Healthcare organizations generate vast amounts of operational and financial data, yet decision-makers often struggle to turn this data into clear, actionable insights.
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze patient demographics, admissions, medical conditions, billing patterns, and hospital performance across multiple years. The goal is to support data-driven decisions in healthcare operations, finance, and resource planning.

## Business Problem
Hospitals and healthcare providers need visibility into:
•	Patient volume trends
•	Billing and revenue drivers
•	Length of stay and cost relationships
•	Performance across hospitals, doctors, and insurance providers
Without centralized analytics, identifying inefficiencies and cost drivers becomes difficult.
This dashboard answers key operational and financial questions using data visualization and descriptive analytics.

## Dataset Description
The dataset spans 2019–2024 and includes patient-level healthcare records such as:
•	Admission type (Elective, Urgent, Emergency)
•	Medical condition
•	Insurance provider
•	Hospital and doctor information
•	Length of stay
•	Billing amounts
•	Patient demographics (age bracket, gender, blood type)
•	Test results and medication data

## Key Metrics Tracked
•	Total Patients: 40.24K
•	Total Billing Amount: 1.40B
•	Average Billing Amount: 25.54K
•	Average Length of Stay: 15.50 days
These KPIs provide a high-level snapshot before drilling into detailed views.

## Dashboard Features & Analysis
1. Patient & Admission Analysis
•	Patient distribution by admission type (Elective, Urgent, Emergency)
•	Patient volume trends by month and year
•	Breakdown of patients by age bracket, gender, and blood type

2. Financial & Billing Insights
•	Total billing amount by:
    o	Medical condition
    o	Hospital
    o	Insurance provider
•	Relationship between length of stay and average billing amount
•	Identification of high-cost conditions and providers

3. Clinical & Operational Insights
•	Patient counts by medical condition and test results
•	Medication usage by test outcome
•	Doctor-level performance:
    o	Number of patients handled
    o	Average length of stay
    o	Total billing contribution

Interactive Filtering
Users can filter insights dynamically by:
•	Year
•	Hospital
•	Admission type
•	Insurance provider
•	Medical condition
•	Gender and age bracket

## Tools & Technologies
•	Power BI Desktop
•	Data modeling using Power BI relationships
•	DAX measures for KPIs and aggregations

## Business Value
This dashboard enables stakeholders to:
•	Identify major cost drivers in healthcare delivery
•	Compare hospital and provider performance
•	Optimize patient flow and resource allocation
•	Support financial planning and policy decisions

### Limitations 
•	Dataset is synthetic / limited to available variables
•	No real-time data integration
### Future improvements:
•	Predictive modeling for length of stay or billing risk
•	Integration with real-time hospital systems
•	Patient outcome and quality-of-care metrics

## Skills Demonstrated
•	Business intelligence and dashboard design
•	KPI definition and stakeholder-focused reporting
•	Healthcare data analysis
•	Data modeling and interactive visualization in Power BI
